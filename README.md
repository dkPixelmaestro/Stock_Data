# Stock_Data

This is a work in progress Stock Data program

At the moment, end goal of the program is for it to obtain stock data such as:
 * High price
 * Low price
 * Close price
 * Adj Close Price
 * Volume

The program sends the data to a csv file which is sent to a directory of the users choice

The process is done by first asking the user for the entire path (starting from root directory) in which they want to store the csv file

The the user is able create a directory if they choose to or provide a path to a existing directory

The file is then created and added to the path provided by the user

 *** This program will be improved on over time ****
